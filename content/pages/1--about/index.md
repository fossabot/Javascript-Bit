I am Divyam Rastogi, a Frontend Developer at [Flock](https://flock.com). I have about six years of experience in Frontend development, and I've worked upon a variety of JS frameworks like Backbone, AngularJS, Angular, React and Vue. I'm a Vue fanboy and don't shy away from admitting it.

I have been writing articles like these for about 4 years but I never publicized those. This is why you might find some content that may seem outdated. 

This application is an installable PWA, and you can add it to your Home Screens when prompted.
